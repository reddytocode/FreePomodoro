# Free Pomodoro

**Free Pomodoro** is a minimalist macOS app, living right in your menu bar.
This app helps you stay productive while maintaining a healthy work-life balance through the Pomodoro Technique.

## Features

- **Simple & Intuitive Interface**: Designed for quick access. My favorite way to access it is by using the Spotlight `Cmd+Space` -> `Free Pomodoro` -> `Enter key`
  
- **25-Minute Work Timer**: Focused work sessions of 25 minutes, scientifically proven to enhance productivity and concentration.

- **5-Minute Rest Timer**: A small break after each work session, helping you recharge and prevent burnout.

- **Enforced Breaks**: The app subtly takes over the menu bar during breaks, encouraging you to step away from work and truly rest. 
So, doesn't matter if you are in silence mode. You can adjust how you want to be notified.
